# Problem Statement
Prediction of apparent temperature using the most related features in the dataset first. Then we’ll try to predict apparent temperature given only the humidity and calculate the accuracy of the model. Is there a relationship between humidity and temperature? What about between humidity and apparent temperature? Can you predict the apparent temperature given humidity?

# The steps, we are going to follow are mentioned below.
• Handle missing values and outliers
• Transformation
• Feature Encoding
• Standardization
• Dimension Reduction (with PCA)
• Model training
